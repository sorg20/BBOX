# BBOX
Simple image classification and localization pytorch code for training and Inference for vegetable data set
## Network architecture
  - I used VGG16 pre trained network
## contents
  - training and validation jupyter notebook use: vege_bbox.ipynb
  - training data 
    - I used data set from 
    [Object-Classification-and-Localization-with-TensorFlow](https://github.com/sorg20/BBOX/edit/master/README.md)
    - Becasue of limitted data set, I did simple image agumentation to help model training 
  - sample data
    - I made vege_example folder for testing
  - pre trained model file: sim_bbox_final.pth
## output example  
  ![see output of trained network bounding box](bounding_box.png)
